2. Attaching more and more complains.
    all complains into an array then use the javascript json_string() method to convert the array to a json string. 


3. Being able to update the complains and medication after the record has been submitted
    Add an Edit Page so that I'm able to edit all that. 
    Change the text field to be able to append more and more complains and ailments.
